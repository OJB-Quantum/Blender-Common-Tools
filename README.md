# Blender-Common-Tools
A repository of Onri's most used tools or sub tools for rendering. 
__________________________________________________________________
• Fast GI Approximation (for faster rendering of lighting scenes besides the use of GPU-accelerated Optix denoising).
• Deleting interior faces (for faster rendering by allowing the system to spend less time on rendering faces that cannot be seen in the render view mode).
• Physics >> Collision >> Field Absorption, Damping, and Friction (set to max to allow particles to stick to selected object).
• Edit Mode >> Face Mode >> press A >> Mesh tab >> Normal >> Recalculate outside (for remeshing).
• Solidify (for adding thickness to an object mesh to use it as a solid 3D model.
• Bake (for calculating associated physics in the Blender model).
• The use of wireframe mode (to select all edges or vertices).
• Screw Modifier (for turning a selected object into a coil shape or similar).
• Render Properties >> Advanced >> Seed >> Click timer box icon (animates the noise texture in the lighting conditions).
_________________________________________________________________________
In Object Mode:
• Add Mesh (for adding 2D and 3D shapes).
• Shade Smooth (for smoothing rough edges of added shapes).
• Modifiers >> Boolean (for merging or cutting added shapes).
• Nurbs [Bezier curve] >> Data >> Geometry >> Bevel >> Depth (for easy creation of wire from surface to surface).
• Modifiers >> Smooth by Angle (for smoothing adjacent edges of selected 3D objects, be sure to select Shade Smooth under the Object tab along with the usage of this tool).
• Ctrl + Shift + [-] (to cut 2 or more overlapping objects after selecting all desired objects, be sure to hide the cutting object's render on the right panel).
___________________________________________________________________________
In Edit Mode (given that you select desired shape):
• Fill [F key] (for filling selected edges that are closed or not open-ended).
• Loop Cut (for sectioning added shapes into smaller sections for modification).
• Shrink/Fatten (for extruding individual or selected vertices, edges, or faces).
• Grid Fill (for closing selected edges).
• Bridge Edge Loops (for closing selected edges between 2 planes).
• Bevel (for selecting edges, extruding it with the E key, selecting a direction to extrude the edge(s) with X, Y, or Z, then using the scale tool or S key to stretch the selected edges inward or outward).
• Add Single Vertex (for extruding an added vertex in vertex selection to draw a modifiable line).
• Right Click >> Limited Dissolve (for simplifying meshes with too many vertices).
• Select tab >> Select All by Trait >> Interior Faces >> Right-Click >> Delete Faces (for deleting faces not expected to display in the render view mode, saves rendering time as well).

I have a personal preference for 3:2 aspect ratio, so here are some resolutions I like:
1620 x 1080 pixels = 3:2 aspect ratio version of 1080p.

2160 x 1440 pixels = 3:2 aspect ratio version of 2K.

3840 x 2560 pixels = 3:2 aspect ratio version of 4K.
